##Description
Offers an alternative to Google's super-useful [PolyModel](http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/datastore/polymodelclass.html) library that lazy-loads data models as they are retrieved in queries. This fixes the problem of having too many non-root PolyModels that are stored in seperate files.
